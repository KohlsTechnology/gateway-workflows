Only the logs that match DNS Edge policies will be sent.    

## Prerequisites  
1. **Additional Python3 Library**  
This workflow requires the python3 *"arrow"*, *"redis"* and the *"apscheduler"* library.  
Install the libraries using PIP3 inside the BlueCat Gateway container.
```
$pip3 install arrow redis apscheduler

```  

2. **Additional Python Code**  
This workflow requires addtional python code.  
Copy the directory *"dnsedge"* under `additional/` to `/portal/bluecat_portal/customizations/integrations/` inside the BlueCat Gateway container.  


## Usage   

1. **Set Parameters**

      The URL should be in the following format:  
      *"https://api-<Your_Edge_CI_URL>"*

    - API Token:  
      This refers to the *"SIEM token"* which the primary administrator receives from DNS Edge.  
      It is written in the initial e-mail from DNS Edge as below:

      If you are not a primary administrator (the administrator with an asterisk) and do not know the SIEM token, please contact the primary administrator of the CI.

    - Syslog Server IP Address:  
      This will be the IP address of the server to send the DNS query logs in a syslog format.  
      Make sure that the specified IP address is reachable from BlueCat Gateway.  

    - Poll Interval (seconds):  
      Enter desired polling intervals.  
      The minimum interval is five seconds.
