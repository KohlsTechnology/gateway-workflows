# Flip Main-DR Servers  
**Bluecat Gateway Version:** 18.10.2 and greater  
**BAM Version:** 9.0.0 and greater  

This workflow will flip the IP addresses of a certain application (servers) from a main site to a disaster recover site while retaining the same FQDN.   
It assumes a disaster recovery (business continuity plan) scenario.    

## Prerequisites
1. **BAM Default Configuration**  
This workflow will be using the default configuration value in `/portal/bluecat_portal/config.py` in BlueCat Gateway container.  To set the default configuration, in BlueCat Gateway, go to Administration > Configurations > General Configuration.  
In General Configuration, select the BAM Settings tab and enter the configuration name under "Default Configuration:" and save.

2. **UDF**  
This workflow requires the following UDF.  
Add the following UDF to Resource Records > Resource Record object in BAM.  
  - Primary    
  Field Name: Primary    
  Display Name: Primary    
  Type: Text  
  - Secondary  
  Field Name: Secondary  
  Display Name: Secondary  
  Type: Text  
  - State  
  Field Name: State  
  Display Name: State  
  Type: Text  
  Predefined Values: Primary | Secondary  

3. **Tag Groups / Tags**  
This workflow requires the following tag groups / tags.    
  - Make a *BCPGroup* tag group in BAM

  - Make an *Application01* tag in tag group *BCPGroup* in BAM

4. **Host Records**  
Create host records in zones. These host records will be a part of the application group.  
Make sure to populate the following fields: *Name, IP Address, Primary, Secondary, State*.  
Make sure to populate different IP addresses for the *Primary* and *Secondary* fields. (Make sure the network exists)   
If the *State* field is selected to *Primary*, then the *IP address* field and the *Primary* field should have the same IP address. Vice versa for the *Secondary* field.  
It should look something like this:

5. **Tag Object**  
Tag the host records to the previously made *Application01* tag.

## Usage  

1. **Specify Application Group**  
From the dropdown menu, specify the application which the IP addresses should be flipped from the primary site to the secondary site (and vice versa).  
In this specific scenario choose *Application01*.

2. **Check Application Server List and Flip**  
Check that the server list has been correctly populated with the host records which was tagged with *Application01*.  
Check that all servers are in their *Primary* state.  
Click *FLIP*.

Check the *Succeed* message.

3. **Check Application Server List for results**  
From the dropdown menu, specify the application group which was just flipped.  
In this specific scenario choose *Application01*.  
Check that the *State* has been changed to *Secondary* and the IP addresses has been changed to the secondary IP address.

    cp en.txt ja.txt  
    ```  
    2. In the BlueCat Gateway web UI, go to Administration > Configurations > General Configuration.
