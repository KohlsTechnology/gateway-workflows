# **Certified Host Record Workflows**
## Add, Delete, and Update Host Records

**BlueCat Gateway Version:** 18.10.2 or greater <br/>
**BAM version:** 8.3.0 or greater <br/>
**Dependencies:** Configuration, View, Zone, Block, and Network previously created in Address Manager <br/>
**Description/Example Usage:** The Host (A) Record designates an IP address for a device. A new Host Record requires a name and an IP address. Using the Host Record workflow, you can add, delete, and update Host Records in a zone. This workflow is ideal for self-service customers using the BlueCat Gateway user interface and for IPAM or DNS administrators to help reduce the repetition usually associated with daily record management.
